  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    CurrencyNut provides a currency converter with optional Premium features.
    By downloading, accessing, or using the CurrencyNut mobile application (the “App”),
    you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
    If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>CurrencyNut offers optional Premium features through auto-renewing subscriptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Yearly:</strong> $34.99 per year</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> 3-day free trial, then $5.99 per month</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Prices are in USD and may vary by region. Payment is charged to your App Store account.
    Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end
    of the current billing period.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device’s Account Settings
    after purchase.

  <h2>Free Trial</h2>
  <p>
    If you start a free trial, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid
    subscription at the end of the trial unless canceled at least 24 hours before the
    trial ends. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited when a subscription is purchased.

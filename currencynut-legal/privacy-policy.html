      App settings such as theme, language, and selected currencies are stored locally on your device.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, or payment information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple or Google and are subject to their
      respective privacy policies. CurrencyNut does not have access to your payment details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    We may collect limited, anonymized analytics data (such as feature usage or crash reports)
    to improve the App. This data does not personally identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can manage subscriptions through your device’s Account Settings.
    You may delete the App at any time to remove all data stored locally on your device.
